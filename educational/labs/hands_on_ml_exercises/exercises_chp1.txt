1. Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.

2. a) Medical diagnosis
b) Trend analysis
c) Online advertising
d) Social media optimization

3. Labeled data is a group of samples that have been tagged with one or more labels.
Labeling typically takes a set of unlabeled data and augments each piece of that unlabeled data with meaningful tags that are informative

4. classification, regression

5.  clustering, association rule learning, neural networks, anomoly detection

6. reinforcement learning

7. clustering

8. supervised

9. Something that learns with real time data. e.g users reporting spam messages to the system, and that system learning from the new
reports

10. Online learning algorithms can also be used to train systems on huge datasets that cannot fit in one machineâ€™s main memory
(this is called out-of-core learning). 
The algorithm loads part of the data, runs a training step on that data, and repeats the process until it has run on all of the data 

11. instance based learning

12. A hyperparameter is a parameter of a learning algorithm (not of the model). 
As such, it is not affected by the learning algorithm itself; it must be set prior to training and remains constant during training.
