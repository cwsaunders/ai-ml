# Logistic Regression
'''
An algorithm for binary classification (1 represents that an item is x and 0 represents that it is not x)
C1W2L01 explains binary classification in detail
Used when Y = 0 or Y = 1 (e.g binary classification problems)


'''

# Notation for course
'''
Video C1W2L01 explains. Also available online.
w = n dimensional vector (weights)
b = real number (regression coefficients)
In code, when computing " dFindOutputVar / dvar " for derivatives. -- represents the derivative of the final output variable
you care about with respect to different intermediaries in your code.
this is represented by "dvar"
'''

# Computing derivatives
'''
When solving for derivatives in practice generally the most important variable is your output variable. (C1W2L08 -- info)
Derivative information C1W2L08 especially around 6-7 minutes.
